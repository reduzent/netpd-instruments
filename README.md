instruments
===========

This is a collection of instruments to be used within
the netpd framework which is hosted at:

  https://github.com/reduzent/netpd

Instruments are Pd patches with certain netpd-specific
properties. They may be synthesizers, sequencers, but can
be anything that can be expressed as Pd patch. In this
repository, instruments for making music collaboratively
are hosted.

Read more [about netpd](https://www.netpd.org/).

Some instruments are [documented](https://www.netpd.org/instruments).

**NOTE**: There are no releases. The instruments are constantly
updated and new ones are added. Do not expect a current checkout
to work with older versions of netpd.
